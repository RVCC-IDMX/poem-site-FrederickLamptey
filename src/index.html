    <h1>Frederick's Comng To America</h1>
    <p>
      The early morning sun shone on my face on the Tuesday morning of Novermber
      6,2018 in a yellow cob home in the slums of Tudu, Accra. I woke up quickly
      with a mixed feeling. It was my last day in Ghana. Deep down, I was happy
      I was leaving the country to America. However, part of me was holding
      back. This part of me was unwilling to leave my old life,my mum and good
      friends behind.I was just emotionally confused! However,time was fast
      running and hence, I went straight to the bathroom to take a shower.
    </p>
    <p>
      At around 2:30pm, I was all dressed up in a blue jeans with white
      longsleeves shirt and a pair of black shoes, ready to head to the Kotoka
      International Airport in Accra, Ghana. Before my taxi whisked my sisters
      and I off at around 3:00pm, I made sure I went to a few friends to say a
      goodbye to them.It was a heartfelt moment I still reminisce about
      sometimes.At around 3:30pm,I arrived together with my sisters at the
      airport. Actually, my dad had told us that our bording time was 4pm and
      hence, we were suppose to be at the airport before 3:40pm. However, we got
      there on time before we realized that 4:00pm wasn't the time for bording,
      but the time to check in early so that the family could have a nice time
      at a nearby pub before the actual departure time.
    </p>
    <p>
      After checking in, the family hopped on one of the airport shuttles to the
      selected pub. After a few minutes drive, we got to the destination and
      everyone alighted. On our table at the pub, we had a lot of beers, sodas
      and khebabs. My family, myself,together with some friends, munched on the
      khebabs while we sucked the beers and sodas. At this moment, it was all
      joy and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now 10:30pm and we had to run back to the terminal 3 to board our
      plane. Myself, togther with my family members I was traveling with, hugged
      and said a goodbye our to relatives and friends that were present to see
      us off. We hopped back into the shuttle, and off we went to the
      aforementioned terminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the terminal 3, I had to join a queue together with my sisters, my dad,
      and stepmom. We eventually went through all the processes required in
      order to board the plane, and at 11:00pm, I had to say a final goodbye to
      Ghana!
